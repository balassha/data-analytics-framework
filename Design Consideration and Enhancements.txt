Design Considerations and Enhancements:
------------------------------------

The primary focus of this application was on the efficieny of queries that will be run on the dataset available.
That was the sole reason to choose elasticsearch as the persistance layer.
The time it takes to response for all the queries is less that 1 second and there are 10m documents in a single ES instance.
This application can be easily scaled if the dataset increases.
With this design, we have a robust analytics framework which can search and get the data as we wish.


Enhancements:
1. Concurrency while flusing Data to ES.
	I had tested the app with concurrent flushing of Bulk request to Elasticsearch but Elasticsearch starting giving errors
	while handling bulk requests each with 500k documents.
	This can be easily solved by deploying a cluster version of Elasticsearch.
	The current app takes average of 3-4 seconds to process 10m documents but with concurrency this can be reduced by 600 - 700 percent.

2. Scale Elastic search to a 3 node cluster 
3. Improve test coverage
