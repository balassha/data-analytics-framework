Install and Setup Instructions:
-------------------------------
The application is written as a docker app with two services. 
1. CLI application - deliveryIndex. It has a Docker file in the same folder as the code. 
The docker image needs to be built first with the following command
	> sudo docker build -t deliveryinfo .
	This will build and place the image in docker image store with the name 'deliveryinfo'.
2. Elastic Search - I am using the docker image of elastic search v7.13 from docker hub.
   This image needs to pulled with the following command
	> docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.0
   Then the docker container needs to be started. The command is as follows.
	> sudo docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.0

After steps 1 & 2, the application should be up and running and ready for use.
The first stage is processing the json file that contains delivery information and flush the data to elasticsearch.
This can be done using the following command
  > sudo docker run -v <Path of Input Json file>:/home deliveryinfo -process -f /home/<Json file name>
	(e.g.: sudo docker run --rm --network=host -v /home/ptm/Desktop:/home deliveryinfo -process -f /home/test.json)
	The application requires the path of the json file to process and flush the data to elasticsearch.
	This takes around 75 seconds. This time can be improved by using a clustered version of Elastic search. 
  Due to time constrains, I stopped with single node. Second reason is that the data set has 10m documents, which a single node can very easily handle

After processing the Json, the application will be ready for getting the required data.

To get more information about the usage, -h or --help can be used as the command
Input command : sudo docker run --rm --network=host -v /home/ptm/Desktop:/home deliveryinfo -h

Output:
Usage of ./app:
  -e string
    	End time of delivery to search (default "3PM")
  -f string
    	JSON file path (default "hf_test_calculation_fixtures.json")
  -i string
    	List of ingredients to search for Recipes. e.g.Potato,Veggie,Mushroom (default "Potato,Veggie,Chops")
  -p string
    	Postcode to find deliveries (default "10120")
  -process
    	Process the input json file and flush to Elasticsearch
  -s string
    	Start time of delivery to search (default "10AM")
  -t int
    	Time to Sleep between Bulk Requests (default 2)
